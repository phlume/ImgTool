LinkGrabber
===========

###About###
This is a simple bookmarklet tool that allows a user to click a web image and retrieve it's associated link, alt text and image path. The use of the tool is relatively simple.
- Drag the bookmarklet to the toolbar of the browser (Chrome or FF).
- Click the bookmarklet on a page you want to retrieve the img information.
- Hover the mouse over the image desired...if the tool can "fetch" the info, the cursor will change.
- Click the desired image (the script disables any links on the page) and a new div will appear.
- Copy the desired info as needed.
- Click F5 to refresh the page and re-enable links.
